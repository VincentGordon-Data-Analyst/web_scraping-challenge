# Background 

For this assignment we are to use our knowlege of web-scrapping to help answer some questions based on some Mars data. Through identifying HTML elements on a website abd finding thier respective id's and class attributes, that information was extracted with the use of two automated browing tools, Splinter and Beautiful Soup.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

The first part of the assignment was to scrape the [Mars news site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) to find the elements needed. This was done by using the "Inspect" tool that can be accessed by right-clicking on the web page. From there, Beautiful Soup was used in conjunction with the elements, id's and class attributes to grab information on the title and the preview for each article post.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

As for the second part of the assignment, through the use of the [Mars Tempearture Data Site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html), some information was gathered for the following tasks:

1. How many months are there on Mars?
2. How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
3. Identify the coldest and hottest months in Curiosity's location
4. Identify the month's with the lowest and highest pressure in Curiosity's location
5. How many terrestrial (earth) days are there in a Martian year?

## Results

1. There are 12 months on Mars
2. There are 1867 days worth of data
3. The coldest month is the 3rd month with a temperature of -83.3 while the hottest month is the 8th month with a temperature of -68.4
4. The 6th month has the lowest pressure of 745.1
and the 9th month has the highest pressure of 913.3
5. Based on the graph, the distance taken between two peaks is 675, which represents the amount of earth days in a Martian year.
